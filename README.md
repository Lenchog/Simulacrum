# SIMULACRUM
Simulacrum is my favourite project so far. It's a currently-prototype sci-fi metroidvania, built in Bevy.
It focuses on exploration and combat, with an abstract story taking inspiration from classic sci-fi.
So far the artwork is placeholder, but I'm working with an artist to improve it.
The engine Iâ€™m using is Bevy, a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust, along with various plugins to enhance functionality.
It is a relatively niche engine, but is a cool concept and I have enjoyed learning something new. It uses a paradigm called ECS; Entity Component System.
Basically OOP if it was actually good.
